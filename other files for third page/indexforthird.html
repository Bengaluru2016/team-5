                <p>The women of mountain region have the great potentiality to successfully carry out dairy farming. Meena Devi is one such woman hailing from Uttarakhand. She's is primarily involved in agriculture along with her husband upon which they earn about Rs 36000/- yearly. But it is a known fact that the prosperity of agriculture relies on varied factors like timely showers, fertilizers used etc. Anything unusual leaves the couple with little or nothing and they can hardly be able to have a three square meal with satisfaction. To make matters worse they will have to bear the extremities of weather as they live in a thatched roof. Further, they are deprived of a proper source of purifying the water. This has made her take up buffalo rearing where by she'll rear it and sell the milk, so as to add an extra rupee to their mere income. As such Meena wants to purchase a buffalo which costs Rs 45000/-. </p>
